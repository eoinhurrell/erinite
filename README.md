# Erinite

Erinite is a web framework for interactive web applications. Erinite allows the
development of both server and client in Clojure(Script) as highly decoupled,
reactive, composable components.

## Rationale

Most of the existing web frameworks follow the "traditional" MVC-like models and
while they work very well for what they were designed to do, the reactive models
used by frameworks such as Hoplon and Pedestal appear to more closely follow the
Clojure philosophies of decomplection and simplicity. Erinite is modelled after
these concepts and looks similar to Pedestal.
Where Erinite hopes to set itself apart from Pedestal is through a composable
mix-and-match component-based architecture and heavier emphasis on
functional-reactive messaging.

## Design Goals

* Loose coupling between components
* Easy independent testing of components
* Simulate components; support recording and playback of execution
* Designer friendly development of UI templates
* Reactive user interaction logic
* Empower interactive development

The following secondary goals exist to enable to above:
* Data-centric design
* Reloadable, restartable compontents
* Communication through functional-reactive messaging
* Ease of hooking in interactive tools
* REPL friendly API

A auxiliary goal of Erinite is to make use of existing libraries and tools
where possible, to avoid duplication of effort and to allow libraries to be
replaced or removed as appropriate. A core philosophy of Clojure is to write
small composable libraries and Erinite should embrace this philosophy whenever
possible.

These goals were chosen so that applications written using Erinite are easy to
develop, easy to test, easy to think about, easy to modify and easy to extend,
even when implementing complex logic or operating at scale. It is dificult to
know future requirements, so enabling quick, safe (breaking changes are caught
early) and convenient modification is the only way to stay ahead of the
competition.


## Design Overview

Erinite provides a layered architecture, splitting an application into Logic and
Services. Services are components that talk to the outside world (client/server,
third party services, databases, user interfaces) while Logic are functions that
transform the application state.

Both the server and client follow an identical architecture (and most of the
implementation is shared code).
